Frontend: Angular + Tailwind

The resume site is deployed by github page, with auto deployment by push to branch `gh-pages`. However, do NOT push anything manually to `gh-pages` as this is updated by github after each build and deployment. What needs to be done is just build and deploy as below.

### Build the site
```
npm run build
```

### Deployment
```
npm run deploy
```
